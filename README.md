# shulea-learn-frontend
This is the shulea learn frontend github repo 
We are making a learning platform that allows students post questions and receive answers from qualified tutors/teachers. This will be the first Kenyan platform bringing tutors with students who face difficulties when doing homework or even revision. The platform will also allow students go live with tutors when getting answers (this feature is not common to many platforms) and through this, we will have taken part in shaping learning for our kids at home Also, shulea learn will have a coin system in which learners purchase coins from the system so as to be able to successfully post an order Tutors who earn shall be able to sell back to the system and the cycle continues The coin system will ensure learners don't always need to deposit to the system all the time and also ensures that the startup generates extra revenue from the arbitrage

shulea learn will still be used by universities and colleges to help organize online learning for students. Our main competitors will be the Kennet web conference and the increased free streaming platforms eg google meet, zoom, ms teams,Zoho etc However, we shall beat the competitors by incorporating class management with the streaming tool. Never duplicate an idea. Build on top of what has been done !
